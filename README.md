# AtliQ Hardware â€“ Sales Performance Analysis

This project analyzes sales data from AtliQ Hardware to generate insights that help drive business decisions. Each report is designed to answer a specific question, not just show a chart.

---

## Why This Project Exists

Most dashboards show what happened.  
This project focuses on **what to do next**.

It connects Excel + Power BI work to real business use cases:
- Where to invest more
- Which products to scale or drop
- How teams should act on missed targets

## What's Covered

| Report | What It Answers |
|--------|------------------|
| **Top 5 Countries** | Where sales are strongest and why it matters |
| **Top & Bottom Products** | Which SKUs need promotion or phase-out |
| **New Products 2021** | How many products were launched in 2021? |
